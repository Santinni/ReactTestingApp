# react-homework

## Tasks

Your task for this take-home project is to implement a simple react application that consumes a Rick and Morty API.
Note that these tasks should take you about 3-4 hours.

Your code should show your ability to produce readable and maintainable code following good developer practices. Good visual styling is a bonus but not very important.

The app might contain bugs,
inappropriately handled things;
so if you find any, fix them.

You can change every piece of code if it suits you,
as long as the tasks are covered.

### Characters page

On this page, a user should be able to view Rick and Morty characters.
The data should be fetched from the https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation API.

- [ ] Check the API and connect the app to it. Consider using a state management library.

- [ ] Add a table of characters

  - name column as text

  - status, gender columns as texts with an icon
  - name of the last known location

- [ ] Implement table pagination or search.

- [ ] On clicking on a table row, open its detail page.

### Detail page

The detail page should contain additional information about a character a user selects.

- [ ] Display details of selected character:

  - an image
  - a name
  - species and type
  - a name of the last known location
  - list of episodes

- [ ] On the Detail page, display a name of the last known location

### Bonus tasks

- [ ] Instead of Create React App, use Vite to build the project.
